# Exercises for Documenting Calculations
Robert Horton  
October 23, 2014  

Using RStudio and RMarkdown, write a brief report to answer one of the following questions (or make up your own question). Include a title, summary, introduction, body and conclusion, though you do not need to subtitle each section. You must perform some calculations to arrive at an answer. Show your data and code as well as the calculated results, cite your data sources, and discuss any assumptions you make. Format the results in PDF, and do not exceed one page in length. Use at least one code block, and use inline R code at least once.

* What percent of the calories in beer come from alcohol?
* What are the relative volumes of an 8-inch square cake pan and a 9-inch diameter round cake pan?
* Using prices and sizes from the website of your favorite pizza purveyor, calculate the cost per square inch for each size of pizza. Estimate crust width, and calculate the fraction of each size pizza that is crust.
* How much does the energy content of gasoline change when you add 10% ethanol?
* What area of solar panels is required to supply the average power requirement of a home?

Please don't spend more than an hour on this assignment. This is supposed to be a confidence-building exercise to convince you that you can do useful, documented analysis with the skills you have already learned. If it does not have that effect, or if it convinces you of anything else, let me know.
